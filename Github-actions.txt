Github actions is a workflow automation service. It can automate all the repository related actions and tasks.

1. Code deployment - Automate code builds, tests and deployments.
2. Code & Repository management - Automate code reviews, issues management, etc.

Git is a source-code version control system.

1. Commits - Code snapshots.
2. Branches - Multiple versions of code. Used for collaboration and to serve multiple environments.
3. Checkout - Copy code between branches and move to different branches.


Github on the other hand is a Git service provider. Github is the one providing the Github actions to manage git repositories.

git add <files> - Add the files to be committed. Also called "staging" action.
git commit -m "<message>" - Push all staged changes to repository.
HEAD - Shows which commit is visible/active. Useful when moving between commits to keep track of our work.
git checkout <commit hash> - To move between commits.
